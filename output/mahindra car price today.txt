Get accurate car valuations by simply entering your registration number. Used car prices are dictated not just by the mileage of the car, but also what optional extras and
                    condition the vehicle is in. We give you three values for your car, based on the following: Your car valuation can vary, depending on the haggling skill of the private seller.
                            The urgency they have to complete the trade is also an important factor. When trading in, a strong market estimate and separating the trades are crucial in getting the best
                            price. Knowing your car's value helps you offer the realistic high-end price for your car as a
                            starting
                            point for bargaining. Free car valuations at a specialized service have the advantage of being quick and painless. Keep in
                            mind that there are typically administration fees and a physical evaluation that will take place.
                            This
                            could reduce the price you were hoping for. Our easy-to-use valuation service allows you to get your car value by simply entering your
                    registration number. However, there are other sources of car valuations on the web, most of which charge for a value. But
                    for a genuine, free car value try a Regit car valuation now. Come back to your digital garage for your valuations at any time and track the car's value with our
                        price change alerts. The things that can increase the value of a car: The paper trail of all maintenance and repair work done on the car is proof that the car has
                                been
                                looked after. Regular maintenance can make your car worth that much more. A car that looks and drives like new is the dream for any buyer. Vehicle valuation offers
                                great returns for cars in near-mint condition, visually and mechanically. The first impression is crucial. A freshly washed and polished car, with a new coat of
                                paint, will significantly raise the car value in the buyer’s eyes. Comfortable, good-looking, clean interiors are a great metric to find out what your car is
                                worth. Make sure to clear it out of your belongings and get it thoroughly washed, for
                                maximum
                                effect. The presence of V5C, MOT certificates, past insurance repairs and receipts are
                                all great to have when deciding your car’s market value. The buyer will have to reobtain any
                                missing
                                documents. The things that can decrease the value of a car: If the car has significant mechanical issues, the pricing of your car will be negatively
                                influenced
                                as well. Damaged internals are typically difficult to replace, but if an opportunity arises
                                it
                                should be a priority. Dents, scratches and having a faded colour will all decrease your car’s value. It can be
                                wise
                                to conduct quick repairs before selling the car. A car with visual issues will often make
                                for a poor
                                first
                                impression. Savvy buyers know that they’ll have to pay the MOT out of their pocket. It can also create
                                doubt about the car’s current state. In the worst case, expect a car price drop if there's
                                no
                                service history. When thinking about how much your car is worth, know that most buyers aren’t looking for a
                                modified car. Modifications are unlikely to raise the price of the car and will make it more
                                difficult to find
                                interested buyers. Sell your car instantly - all online and completely free Valuating your car provides an answer to that question. It helps you know the price range you're working
