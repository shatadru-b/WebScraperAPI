News / Entertainment The Edinburgh show will be the only UK stop for the band. Tens of thousands of AC/DC fans are set to descend on Edinburgh as the band return to Scotland for the first time in a decade. The rock giants will take to the stage at Murrayfield Stadium on Thursday evening as the only UK performance on their ongoing Power Up tour. Originally from Australia, the band has a strong Scottish fanbase thanks to Forfar-born member Bon Scott and brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, hailing from Glasgow. Scott spent his early years in Kirrie before his family emigrated to Australia. He died in February 1980 and was replaced as AC/DC frontman by Brian Johnson. Angus and Brian will be joined by rhythm guitarist (and Angusâ€™s nephew) Stevie Young, drummer Matt Laug and bassist Chris Chaney. Stevie initially joined the fold to fill in for Malcolm when he was diagnosed with dementia. Following his death in 2017, Stevie remained with the band. The tour comes in support of their latest album by the same name, released in 2020. As well as the latest release, the band will be playing their iconic rock songs includingÂ Back In Black,Â Hells Bells,Â Thunderstruck and Let There Be Rock.  Fans will be able to head into Murrayfield from 5pm. Support will come from The Pretty Reckless â€“ an American rock band from New York City fronted by Taylor Momsen.  The band are reportedly due on stage around 8.15pm with the show wrapping up by 10.45pm. Gigs in Scotland announced that a limited number of tickets were released on Wednesday ahead of the show, so those without could still be in with a chance.

The veteran hard rockers will be in Scotland for the grand finale of their Power Up European tour Last year, to the disappointment of thousands of hard rocker Brits, Londonâ€™s Wembley Stadium was ACDCâ€™s only stop on the UK leg of their Power Up tour. But then in February, they announced a new string of dates andÂ revealed that their second European leg would conclude at Edinburghâ€™s Murrayfield Stadium. The legendary bandâ€™s long-standing members Angus Young (in his signature school uniform) and Brian Johnson are now joined by rhythm guitarist (and Angusâ€™s nephew) Stevie Young, drummer Matt Laug and bassist Chris Chaney. For an idea of what to expect, the Guardian called last yearâ€™s show at Wembley â€˜a poignant lesson on the power of rockâ€™nâ€™rollâ€™, while the Evening Standard said it was â€˜a thundering rock â€˜nâ€™ roll epicâ€™. This weekâ€™s gigÂ will be the bandâ€™s first show in Scotland in a decade, their only UKÂ performance in 2025 and the final Power Up show in Europe before they goÂ home to play venues acrossÂ Oz. So, from the setlist and seating plan to stage times and last-minute resale tickets, hereâ€™s all the essential info you need before heading to Murrayfield Stadium for AC/DC. The rockersâ€™Â ScottishÂ stadium gig is on Thursday, August 21. Fans will be able to enter the stadium from 5pm . TheÂ bandÂ is due to appear on stage at around 8.15pm , with the show concluding by 10.45pm. Hereâ€™s the layout of Murrayfield Stadium for AC/DCâ€™s final Power Up show. Taylor Momsenâ€™s band The Pretty Reckless will be warming up the crowds forÂ AC/DC in Edinburgh. Theyâ€™reÂ expected to take to the stage at 6.45pm. While the band does slightly tweak their setlist each night, there are plenty of core bangers that stay the same. Based on one of AC/DCâ€™s recent shows in Germany, you can expect the night to go something like this: AC/DC at Murrayfield StadiumÂ was completely sold out but there are a few resale tickets available on Ticketmaster . At the time of writing they start from Â£151 each. Murrayfield doesnâ€™t have a bag drop facility, and the stadium strongly encourages visitors not to bring a bag. Ticket holders are allowed one bag per person, and it must be smaller than A4 size. Hereâ€™s a full list of banned items at Murrayfield: Right now, the weather in Edinburgh is looking pretty good when AC/DC come to town. Thereâ€™ll be sunny intervals all day, changing to partly cloudy in the evening.Â Between 4pm and 10pm, the temperature will range from 15C to 18C.

There's only one night to go until iconic Australian rockers ACDC take to the Edinburgh stage, with a huge stadium gig at Murrayfield on August 21. The global PWR/UP Tour has been travelling Europe all summer, with dates all over the continent. Tomorrow's Edinburgh gig will close the European leg of the legends' tour, named after their 2020 album Power Up. And lucky for rock fanatics, tickets are still available. Those already in possession of tickets to the long-awaited gig should start planning their Edinburgh trip now, or risk getting stuck in the crowd of some 70,000. Knowing how to get to Murrayfield, as well the ideal strategy for getting home safely and efficiently, and knowing what to bring with you are essential bits of info for a gig so large. For those headed to Murrayfield tomorrow night, we've rounded up all the most crucial information in one place. And those who still haven't purchased tickets can scroll down the page for info on how to get them before they sell out. Here's everything to know about the upcoming ACDC gig. Murrayfield Stadium is a 23-minute walk from Haymarket train station, according to Google Maps, so those travelling into Edinburgh from elsewhere for the gig would do well to get off the train here. Be mindful that Waverly Station is a fair bit further to Murrayfield, although plenty buses or trams are available to get to the stadium from there. Scroll down for all the best inner city bus options. ScotRail is also adding additional services and capacity specifically for fans tomorrow night, including late-night trains to key destinations such as Glasgow Queen Street, Dundee, Perth, and Dunblane. It's vital to check the last trains from Waverly or Haymarket to your home destination, or you may risk missing it and getting swept away by the crowd. Direct coach services from Citylink will run from Dundee, Perth Broxden, Halbeath Park and Ride and Kinross Park and Ride to take you straight to Scottish Gas Murrayfield Stadium in time for the show. However, Citylink notes that because these are special services, NEC cards won't be valid. Flixbus and Megabus also offer varied options for those travelling from further afield to Edinburgh city centre. If you've made your way to town in Edinburgh, several Lothian buses will take you straight to the doorstep of Murrayfield (where there are also many pubs to have a pint before heading in). The standard adult single fare for Lothian buses is Â£2.20. Some Lothian bus options include: You can get off at Roseburn Gardens or Murrayfield Road to be deposited just outside the venue. Other buses that pass by Murrayfield include the Citylink 900 to Glasgow, although this option may also be pricier than Lothian buses. The full list of prohibited items for Murrayfield Stadium is as follows: Seated tickets for ACDC Murrayfield are still available on a few sites such as Ticketmaster, where they're currently going for Â£103.70 each. Fans can also grab a ticket for the Edinburgh leg of the PWR/UP Tour on Viagogo, where plenty of sitting or standing tickets are being sold for various prices.
