The rock giants will take to the stage at Murrayfield Stadium on Thursday evening as the only UK performance on their ongoing Power Up tour. Originally from Australia, the band has a strong Scottish fanbase thanks to Forfar-born member Bon Scott and brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, hailing from Glasgow. Scott spent his early years in Kirrie before his family emigrated to Australia. He died in February 1980 and was replaced as AC/DC frontman by Brian Johnson. Angus and Brian will be joined by rhythm guitarist (and Angusâ€™s nephew) Stevie Young, drummer Matt Laug and bassist Chris Chaney. Stevie initially joined the fold to fill in for Malcolm when he was diagnosed with dementia. Following his death in 2017, Stevie remained with the band. The tour comes in support of their latest album by the same name, released in 2020. As well as the latest release, the band will be playing their iconic rock songs including Back In Black
